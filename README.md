# Diesel City Directory
THe Diesel City Directory is a database of food & drink businesses, venues and cultural events located or occuring in the imaginary location of Diesel City. It would be useful to anyone running a local business, living in or around Diesel City or anyone visiting the area, enabling them to promote their business, connect with services they require, discover places to visit or events to attend and enjoy. The data is stored in relational databases and users can create, read, update and delete information according to their needs.
The live site can be found [here](http://)

## UX

### Colour Scheme


### Typography

I used [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) to select two similar yet distinctly different fonts for the main body of text and the quote references, with a third handwritten style font, chosen direct from google fonts, for the large quotes on the landing page, to suggest the personal nature of an individual quote.  I settled on Poppins for the main body, Sintony for the quote references and Dancing Script for the handwritten styling of the quote itself.

### User Stories
-   _Users visiting the site may have a number of different missions._
    - As a new user, I want the site to be intuitive and navigable, so that I know where I am on the site and where I can get to.
    - As a user who wants to find information, I want to be able to search or use menus to locate the information I require
    - As a user who wants to promote their business or event I want to be able to easily create, update and delete information as things often change over time, and I want this information to be secure so that bad actors cannot change it 
    - As a visitor to diesel city I want to be able to find out any events that may be occuring over the period of my stay
    - As the owner of the website, I want to promote my own webservices to local business
    - As the owner of the site I want to generate traffic through the site and collect revenue from users clicking through to and buying from promoted businesses, onsite advertising, and user data.
